# [SQL Ad_hoc] Retail Sales Returns Analytics Dataset
---
## 1. Introduction 
This dataset provides a comprehensive view of a retail business's operations over a three-year period (2015‚Äì2017). It includes detailed records of sales transactions, customer profiles, product catalog, and return data, making it an excellent foundation for conducting end-to-end business analysis.  

The data is structured into multiple relational tables that simulate a real-world retail environment, enabling advanced SQL queries for revenue analysis, customer segmentation, product performance evaluation, and return behavior tracking.  

üß± **Dataset Structure**
- **Customers**: Demographic and behavioral data for each customer, including income, education, occupation, and homeownership status.
- **Products**: Details about products such as name, model, color, size, cost, and price, along with their subcategories and categories.
- **Sales (2015, 2016, 2017)**: Transactional records with order details, customer IDs, product IDs, and quantity sold.
- **Returns**: Data on returned products, including quantity and date.
- **Product Categories & Subcategories**: Hierarchical mapping of products to subcategories and main categories.

## 3. Exploring the Dataset
In this project, I will write 05 queries in SQL Server Management Studio to tackle the problems defined above  
**Business Objective**:
- Does revenue tend to increase or decrease over time?
- Top-selling products each year (by number of units sold) 
- Compare revenue and growth rate year by year
- Top 5 products with the most returns 
- Calculate the total sales, revenue and profit, profit margin, and total number of returns for each modelName  

**Query 01: Total revenue by month/quarter/year**

**Insights**
- Consistent revenue growth: Revenue shows a strong upward trend from 2015 to mid-2017, with the overall trajectory confirmed by the trendline.  
- Noticeable revenue fluctuations: Several sharp dips and spikes occur, especially around mid-2015 and early 2017, indicating potential volatility.

**Recommendations**
- Scale what works: Identify and double down on strategies or campaigns that drive peak revenue months to sustain long-term growth.
 Stabilize performance: Investigate causes of revenue dips and implement forecasting or inventory strategies to reduce fluctuations.

**Query 02: Best-Selling Products by Year (by quantity sold)**

**Insights**
- High-profit concentration: A small number of models (e.g., Mountain-200, Road-550-W) contribute the majority of overall profit, with strong margins and solid sales volume.
- Unprofitable models: Several products (e.g., Touring-1000, Road-150, Road-750) generate high revenue but suffer from negative profit margins, indicating pricing, cost, or return issues.

**Recommendations**
- Double down on winners: Prioritize investment in high-performing models through increased marketing, optimized inventory, and bundling with accessories to drive higher revenue per transaction.
- Fix or phase out poor performers: Audit unprofitable products to identify causes (e.g., costs, pricing, returns) and take action ‚Äî either improve their economics or discontinue to reduce losses.
